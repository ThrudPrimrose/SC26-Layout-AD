# SC26 Layout Artifact — Experiments

Reproducibility root for the six experiments described in the Appendix
(Artifact Description). Each `EX_*/` folder is a self-contained
benchmark; `common/` holds the shared setup used by every experiment.

## Layout

E0 is a one-shot NUMA-aware STREAM peak baseline (≈ 2 min). E1–E5 are
mutually independent — a reviewer can dispatch up to five `sbatch` jobs
in parallel. E6 is the longest single experiment; run it last (or on a
separate allocation). Jobs marked *download* require a one-time data
fetch before the first submission.

The proof-illustration figures (Figures 2–3 in the main text) live in
[`../Figures/`](../Figures/) — pure matplotlib scripts, no benchmark,
and no submission to SLURM. Regenerate with `bash ../Figures/plot_all.sh`.

The paper's **runtime figures** (Figures 4, 8–13) have two dedicated
drivers in the top-level [`../Figures/`](../Figures/) folder. Both
iterate over E1–E5 and `E6_VelocityTendencies/loopnest_{1..6}`:

| Driver | Reads from | Writes to |
|---|---|---|
| [`../Figures/plot_paper_snapshot.sh`](../Figures/plot_paper_snapshot.sh) | [`../PaperSnapshot/<exp>/results/`](../PaperSnapshot/) (frozen paper-canonical CSVs) | `../Figures/GeneratedFigures/Runtime/<stem>.{pdf,png}` |
| [`../Figures/plot_results.sh`](../Figures/plot_results.sh) | `<exp>/results/` (your local CSVs after `sbatch`) | **`<exp>/results/<stem>.{pdf,png}` — next to the CSVs** |

Neither script overwrites the other: the paper snapshot lands in
`Figures/GeneratedFigures/Runtime/` while reviewer-generated figures
live inside each experiment's `results/` folder alongside the CSVs
they were plotted from. An experiment you haven't re-run is simply
skipped by `plot_results.sh`; an empty `PaperSnapshot/<exp>/results/`
is skipped by `plot_paper_snapshot.sh`. Either way the sweep never
aborts on a single missing dataset.

Both drivers export `MATPLOTLIBRC=../Figures/matplotlibrc`, pinning
every figure to **DejaVu Sans** — no STIX / Computer-Modern fallback
warnings on stock environments.

`plot_all.sh` is the umbrella that runs illustrative groups + `Peaks`
(stream-peak JSON refresh) + both runtime drivers in sequence:

```bash
bash ../Figures/plot_paper_snapshot.sh    # paper-canonical runtime figures
bash ../Figures/plot_results.sh           # your runtime figures (need sbatch first)
bash ../Figures/plot_all.sh               # everything above + illustrative
bash ../Figures/plot_all.sh Peaks         # just refresh common/stream_peak.json
bash ../Figures/plot_all.sh Runtime       # paper + results, no illustrative
```

## How to run any experiment

Every experiment uses the same three-step flow.

### 1. One-time global setup (run once per machine)

```bash
bash common/setup.sh
```

`spack load`s a pinned CPython + `sqlite` (arch auto-detect:
`python/asgm25z` on x86_64 / zen3, `python/6kewgi6` on aarch64 /
neoverse_v2). Readline, bz2, lzma, ctypes, ssl, zlib all come baked
into the spack python via RPATH, so only `sqlite` is `spack load`ed
externally. The script then creates a venv at `common/venv` using that
python (with a pip bootstrap workaround — see note below), clones
DaCe into `common/dace` on branch `yakup/dev`, `pip install -e`'s it,
and pip-installs numpy / scipy / matplotlib / pandas.

Override the DaCe branch when needed (E6 full module uses
`f2dace/staging`):

```bash
DACE_BRANCH=f2dace/staging bash common/setup.sh
```

Override the python spec to pin a specific hash:

```bash
SC26_PYTHON_SPEC=python/6kewgi6 bash common/setup.sh   # force aarch64 hash
```

> **Venv caveats on spack CPython** — spack's CPython build ships with
> empty `venv/scripts/{common,posix}` template dirs and a missing pip
> wheel in `ensurepip/_bundled/`. `setup.sh` works around both:
> creates the venv with `--without-pip`, bootstraps pip via
> `get-pip.py`, and activates the venv by exporting `VIRTUAL_ENV` +
> `PATH` directly (no `bin/activate` exists). `activate.sh` does the
> same manual activation. Do not try to `source venv/bin/activate` —
> it doesn't exist.

### 2. Submit or run on a cluster

```bash
cd EX_Name
sbatch run_daint.sh       # Daint.Alps  (Grace CPU + Hopper GPU)
sbatch run_beverin.sh     # Beverin     (Zen4 CPU + MI300A APU)
```

Each `run_*.sh` internally sources:

1. `../common/activate.sh` — re-loads the spack python, activates the
   `common/venv`, and ensures DaCe is on the correct branch.
2. `../common/setup_daint.sh` *or* `../common/setup_beverin.sh` —
   loads platform modules (spack), sets OMP/SLURM pinning, and
   exports `CPU_CXX`, `CPU_CXXFLAGS`, `CPU_LDFLAGS`, `GPU_CXX`,
   `GPU_CXXFLAGS`, `GPU_LDFLAGS`.

The run script then builds CPU + GPU binaries using those flag
variables and writes CSV results to `results/{daint,beverin}/`.

### Canonical compile flags

Both setup scripts export the same flag set, differing only where the
toolchain forces it. Treat this set as authoritative — every ad-hoc
`g++` / `nvcc` / `hipcc` invocation in the repo (including the Python
drivers in E3 and the DaCe compile helper under E6) carries the same
flags.

| Toolchain | Flags |
|---|---|
| **g++ (CPU)** | `-O3 -ffast-math -fno-trapping-math -fno-math-errno -march=native -mtune=native -fno-vect-cost-model -fopenmp -std=c++17` |
| **nvcc (Daint)** | device: `-O3 --use_fast_math`; host via `-Xcompiler=`: the full CPU set plus `-Xcompiler=-march=native -Xcompiler=-mtune=native` |
| **hipcc (Beverin)** | same as CPU minus `-fno-vect-cost-model` (Clang has no equivalent), plus HIP-specific `-munsafe-fp-atomics`, `-mllvm -amdgpu-early-inline-all=true`, etc. |

`-fno-trapping-math` / `-fno-math-errno` are already implied by
`-ffast-math`; they are listed explicitly to make intent survive any
future `-ffast-math` definition drift.

### OpenMP scheduling

`OMP_SCHEDULE=static` is exported by both setup scripts, and every
`#pragma omp parallel for` in the repo uses `schedule(static)`
explicitly. No dynamic / guided / runtime / auto scheduling anywhere in
our sources — chosen deliberately to minimize timing jitter.

CPU pinning is handled via `SLURM_CPU_BIND=cores` (set in each setup
script) — no `#SBATCH --cpu-bind` flags are needed.

For interactive debugging without SLURM:

```bash
source common/activate.sh
source common/setup_daint.sh       # or setup_beverin.sh
cd EX_Name && bash run_daint.sh
```

### 3. Plot

```bash
cd EX_Name
python plot_paper.py
```

Reads `results/{daint,beverin}/*.csv` and writes the paper figure(s).

## Data-loading scripts and what they assume

Every data download is a one-time step gated behind an explicit
`bash download_data.sh`. No experiment fetches data at `sbatch` time.

| Script | Fetches | Size | Assumes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`E4_GAS/download_data.sh`](E4_GAS/download_data.sh) | BaTiO₃ indirect-access index set for `zaxpy` | ≈ 200 MB | Outbound HTTPS (ETH PolyBox); run from inside `E4_GAS/`; idempotent (skips if already present). |
| [`E5_USXX/download_data.sh`](E5_USXX/download_data.sh) | Serialized BaTiO₃ state for QE `addusxx_g` | ≈ 1 GB | Outbound HTTPS (ETH PolyBox); run from inside `E5_USXX/`; writes to `bin/`. |
| [`E6_VelocityTendencies/loopnest_1/download_data.sh`](E6_VelocityTendencies/loopnest_1/download_data.sh) | ICON R02B05 velocity-tendencies serialized input | ≈ 3 GB | Outbound HTTPS; required for every `loopnest_{1..6}` subtask. |
| [`E6_VelocityTendencies/full_velocity_tendencies/scripts/download_nproma20480_data.sh`](E6_VelocityTendencies/full_velocity_tendencies/scripts/download_nproma20480_data.sh) | ICON full-module `nproma=20480` dataset | ≈ 8 GB | Outbound HTTPS; required for stage4/stage8 full-module sweeps. |

E0, E1, E2, E3, and the `Figures/` proof illustrations all synthesize
their inputs in-process (no network access required).

### Cleaning up after crashes

If a benchmark segfaults on Alps/Daint, SLURM may leave multi-GB
`core_nid*` core dumps scattered across the experiment tree. Clear them
with:

```bash
bash clean_core_dumps.sh             # dry-run: count + total size
bash clean_core_dumps.sh --delete -y # actually remove
```

The script resolves its own location so it runs correctly regardless
of the current working directory.

Setup / environment-loading scripts and their assumptions:

| Script | Loads | Assumes |
|---|---|---|
| [`common/setup.sh`](common/setup.sh) | spack python + sqlite; venv at `common/venv` (pip bootstrapped via get-pip.py); DaCe clone + editable install; plotting deps | `spack` on PATH; short-hash specs resolve for the current arch (`uname -m` auto-select); outbound HTTPS to pypi + github. |
| [`common/activate.sh`](common/activate.sh) | spack python + sqlite; manual venv activation (exports `VIRTUAL_ENV` + `PATH`); DaCe branch check | `setup.sh` has been run; `DACE_BRANCH` defaults to `yakup/dev`; `SC26_PYTHON_SPEC` arch-auto-detects (override to force). |
| [`common/setup_daint.sh`](common/setup_daint.sh) | GCC 14, CUDA 12.9, OpenBLAS 0.3.29, OpenMP / SLURM pinning for Grace | Daint.Alps (linux-sles15-neoverse_v2); spack env with those specs. |
| [`common/setup_beverin.sh`](common/setup_beverin.sh) | GCC 14, ROCm 6.x, OpenBLAS 0.3.30, OpenMP / SLURM pinning for Zen4 | Beverin (linux-sles15-zen3); spack env with those specs; ROCm at `/opt/rocm`. |

## Reviewer hint — `# TODO: VERSION`

Version-sensitive knobs in this artifact are marked with `# TODO: VERSION`
in the scripts. A reviewer may need to adjust:

- [`../../setup.sh`](../../setup.sh) — pinned `SPACK_*` short hashes
  (`python/asgm25z`, `readline/sg63hivx`, …). Regenerate with
  `spack find -L <pkg> target=zen3` if the spack env is re-concretized.
- [`common/setup.sh`](common/setup.sh) / [`activate.sh`](common/activate.sh)
  — `SC26_PYTHON_SPEC` (auto: `python/asgm25z` zen3 / `python/6kewgi6`
  neoverse_v2), `sqlite` short hash per arch, `DACE_BRANCH=yakup/dev`.
  All overridable via env vars.
- [`common/setup_{daint,beverin}.sh`](common/) — GCC / ROCm / CUDA /
  OpenBLAS spack specs.
- `EX_*/download_data.sh` — dataset URL; if the upstream mirror moves,
  edit the URL at the top of the script.

## Hardware

- **Daint.Alps** — quad-GH200 node, 72-core Grace Neoverse V2 CPU
  (512 GB/s LPDDR5X) + H200 GPU (4 TB/s HBM3). STREAM Triad peak:
  CPU 1.807 TB/s, GPU 3.780 TB/s.
- **Beverin** — quad-MI300A APU node, 24 Zen4 cores sharing 128 GB
  unified HBM3. STREAM Triad peak: CPU 1.161 TB/s, GPU 4.294 TB/s.

Both clusters access required: SLURM, exclusive single-node
allocations.

## Software

- Spack-provided CPython 3.13.8 on zen3 (`python/asgm25z`) /
  neoverse_v2 (`python/6kewgi6`); venv at `common/venv` (pip
  bootstrapped via get-pip.py; manual activation).
- DaCe branch `yakup/dev` for E0–E5 and E6/loopnest_1;
  branch `f2dace/staging` for E6/full_velocity_tendencies
- Spack-provided GCC 14, CUDA 12.9 (Daint) / ROCm 6.4.1 (Beverin),
  OpenBLAS 0.3.29 (Daint) / 0.3.30 (Beverin), cuTENSOR / hipTensor
  (E3 only), HPTT (E3 only)
- Spack-provided `sqlite` (other stdlib C-ext prereqs — readline,
  bz2, lzma, ctypes, ssl, zlib — are baked into the spack python
  via RPATH, not loaded separately).
- Python deps: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas (installed by setup.sh)

## Single-source CUDA/HIP pattern

Every GPU benchmark has a canonical `.cu` file plus a matching
`*_hip.cpp` file. The `.cu` is the single source of truth — it calls
`gpu*` (e.g. `gpuMalloc`, `gpuMemcpy`, `gpuDeviceSynchronize`) which
`common/gpu_compat.cuh` dispatches to `cuda*` under nvcc and `hip*`
under `hipcc -x hip`. The `*_hip.cpp` file is a 7-line shim that just
`#include`s its `.cu` companion so hipcc has a recognisable
translation-unit extension. **Do not edit the `_hip.cpp` shims; edit
the `.cu`.**

## Expected time budget

~22 hr per cluster end-to-end: ≈ 2 min for E0 (NUMA baseline) + 90 +
210 + 180 + 60 + 60 min for E1–E5
(≈ 10 hr, parallelizable across five independent `sbatch` jobs) plus
≈ 11.5 hr for E6 (loopnest 1 ≈ 150 min, loopnests 2–6 ≈ 300 min,
full-module sweep ≈ 240 min), plus ≈ 25 min for one-time setup and
post-run analysis. Per-experiment and per-cluster breakdown is in the
AD appendix (Table "\arttime").
